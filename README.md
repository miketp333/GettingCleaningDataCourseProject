README File For run_analysis.R File For Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

STEP 1
Activity, Subject and Features data are read into R. This results in 6 tables of data.

STEP 2
Train and Test files are combined into 1 table for each data set: Activity, Subject and Features.
This results in 3 tables.

STEP 3
Column names are assigned to each table.

STEP 4
The 3 tables are merged into 1 table which is used for analysis.
This table is filtered to only include mean and standard deviation columns.

STEP 5
The activity column is updated to show the name of the activity, rather than the id.

STEP 6
Column names are cleaned.

STEP 7
Tidy data set is created. All data is averaged and grouped by subject and activity.
